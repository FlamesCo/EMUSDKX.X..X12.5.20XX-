Welcome to the EMUSDKX.X..X12.5.20XX repository! This project is dedicated to emulating the Nintendo Ultra Simulator (UltraSim), a proprietary Nintendo 64 emulator created by Silicon Graphics around mid-1995. This emulator was crucial in providing developers a testing environment for their games while the Nintendo 64's hardware was still in development.

## Overview

UltraSim is known for utilizing the simulators present in the Oman Archive, including the algorithm simulator, the I/O simulator, the co-simulation, the reality display processor simulator, and the reality signal processor simulator. These simulators are designed to be fast, bit-accurate, and as clock-accurate as possible.

Despite its historical significance, UltraSim has never been publicly released, and no screenshots or footage of the program in action have surfaced online. The EMUSDKX.X..X12.5.20XX project aims to recreate this legendary emulator, using the remnants present within the Oman Archive and other available resources.

## Features

- **Algorithm Simulator:** Replicates the original algorithm processing capabilities of UltraSim.
- **I/O Simulator:** Provides an accurate emulation of the input/output operations.
- **Co-Simulation:** Facilitates the co-operative simulation of multiple systems.
- **Reality Display Processor Simulator:** Emulates the graphics processing unit of the Nintendo 64.
- **Reality Signal Processor Simulator:** Simulates the audio processing unit of the Nintendo 64.

## Installation

Instructions on how to install and run the emulator will be provided here.

## Usage

Details on how to use the emulator, including loading games and accessing different features.
